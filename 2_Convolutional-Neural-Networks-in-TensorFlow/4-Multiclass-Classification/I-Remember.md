# I Remember
> Coming from **first principles** in understanding how ML works, to using a DNN to do basic computer vision, and then beyond into convolutions.  

With convolutions, we saw how to extract features from an image, and saw the tools in **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build with `convolutions` and `pooling` as well as handling complex, multi-sized images.

Through this, we saw how overfitting can have an impact on classifiers, and explored some strategies to avoid it, including **image augmentation**, **dropout**, and **transfer learning**. 

## Wrap:
> We looked at the considerations in code to build a model for multi-class classification for this specific undertaking!
