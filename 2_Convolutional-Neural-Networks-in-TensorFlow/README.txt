Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Network Programming in Depth.

Looking at a larger dataset, downloading and preparing it for training, as well as handling some preprocessing of data. Even data like this which has been carefully curated for you can have errors -- as you'll notice with some corrupt images! Might not impact the model! :)
