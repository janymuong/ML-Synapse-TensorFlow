Understanding Sentiment in Text:

- When training a neural network we deal w/ the tokenization of text. This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character.
- We'll learn about the Tokenizer and pad_sequences APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks!
