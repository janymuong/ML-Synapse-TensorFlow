Beyond training a neural network based on NLP and classification, we can use the knowledge(from them) for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once we've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, we'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of its own!
